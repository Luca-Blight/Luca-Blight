# Hey, I'm Zack

**Senior AI Fullstack Engineer @ [Astra](https://wati.io/) | NYC**

Building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI agents, data engineering, and scalable infrastructure.

## What I'm Working On

- **DevMatch** - AI-powered talent discovery platform using knowledge graphs and multi-agent search
- **Astra** - Lead qualification and AI agent optimization at scale

## Tech Stack

```
AI/ML           RAG | Multi-Agent Systems | LangChain | PydanticAI | BAML | Langfuse
Data            Python | SQL | GraphDB | VectorDB | ETL | Data Warehousing
Backend         Go | FastAPI | Redis | GraphQL | gRPC | REST
Infrastructure  AWS | Terraform | Docker | Kubernetes | Vercel
```

## Areas of Focus

### Knowledge Graphs & Ontology Design
- **PROV-O Ontology** - Provenance data modeling for tracking entities, activities, and agents
- **Graph Schema Design** - Node/relationship modeling for complex domain representations
- **Cypher Query Optimization** - Multi-hop traversals, aggregations, and graph pattern matching
- **Hybrid Search** - Combining graph traversal with vector similarity for semantic retrieval

### LLM Evaluation & Observability
- **LLM-as-Judge** - Automated evaluation pipelines with structured rubrics and scoring criteria
- **Synthetic Data Generation** - Persona-based test case generation for diverse evaluation coverage
- **Tracing & Instrumentation** - End-to-end observability with Langfuse and OpenTelemetry
- **Dataset Management** - Golden datasets, A/B experiment tracking, and regression testing
- **Structured Outputs** - BAML type-safe LLM function definitions with streaming support

## Experience Highlights

**Astra @ Wati** - Senior AI Fullstack Engineer
- 10x improvement in VectorDB QPS while maintaining latency
- 4x increase in agent QPS, 2x reduction in TTFT after framework migration
- Full Langfuse observability integration for debugging and evals

**Lucidity** - Founder
